# Wine Quality Prediction Using Machine Learning (R)

## Business Problem
Wine quality assessment is traditionally based on expert sensory evaluation, which is subjective,
time-consuming, and costly. The goal of this project is to predict wine quality using measurable
physicochemical properties, enabling data-driven quality control and decision-making.

## Objective
To develop a machine learning model that accurately predicts wine quality ratings based on
chemical attributes such as acidity, alcohol content, sulphates, and pH.

## Dataset
The dataset contains physicochemical properties of wine samples including:
- Fixed acidity
- Volatile acidity
- Citric acid
- Residual sugar
- Chlorides
- Free & total sulfur dioxide
- Density
- pH
- Sulphates
- Alcohol

Target variable: **Wine Quality Score**

## Tools & Technologies
- R Programming
- Random Forest Algorithm
- Caret
- openxlsx
- tcltk (GUI-based prediction system)

## Approach
1. Data cleaning and preprocessing
2. Exploratory data analysis
3. Feature selection and model training
4. Random Forest model implementation
5. Model evaluation and validation
6. GUI development for real-time prediction

## Model & Evaluation
- Algorithm: Random Forest
- Handles non-linear relationships and feature interactions effectively
