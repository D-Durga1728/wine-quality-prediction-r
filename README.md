## Wine Quality Prediction Using Random Forest

### Business Objective
To predict wine quality based on physicochemical properties, helping
manufacturers maintain consistent product quality.

### Dataset
Wine Quality dataset containing acidity, sugar, sulphates, alcohol, etc.

### Tools & Technologies
- R Programming
- Random Forest
- Caret
- Tkinter GUI (tcltk)

### Approach
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Train-test split
- Random Forest model training
- Model evaluation
- GUI-based quality prediction

### Results
- Achieved ~XX% accuracy on test data
- Alcohol and sulphates were key predictors

### Key Learnings
- Practical application of ensemble models
- Feature importance interpretation
- End-to-end ML deployment using GUI
